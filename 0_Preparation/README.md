# 0. Preparation phase

The objective of this work was to map the pedestrian network of a 5,32kmÂ² area within the Alvalade parish, defined in the image below.

To achieve this, it was decided to use the [QField app](https://qfield.org/), a mobile app for field work that is compatible with the open source software [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/). It allows to fill [QGIS Forms](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/training_manual/create_vector_data/forms.html) on the mobile phone, simplifying the data collection workload.

The work was divided between eight students, each one assigned a different part of the case study area, described in the image below.

The data collection process is described in the [Mapping the walking network.pdf](./Mapping%20the%20walking%20network.pdf) document, which details:

- The types of data that where collected;
- How to install and sign up to QField;
- How to collect data on sight.

> **DISCLOSURE**
>
> QField relies on [QField Cloud](https://qfield.cloud/) to ease the synchronization process with QGIS. Due to the 100mb limit per user and the narrow time window to wait for the procedures to buy an organizational account by the university, it was decided to use an individual account per student, which introduced an extra step in the data treatment process: the aggregation, explored in the next chapter.
