# Mapping a pedestrian network

This repository aims to document the creation of a pedestrian network for the [Alvalade neighborhood, in Lisbon](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Alvalade,+Lisbon/@38.7549497,-9.1655542,14z/).

It was created within the scope of the development of a [Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan](https://urban-mobility-observatory.transport.ec.europa.eu/sustainable-urban-mobility-plans_en) focused on accessibility. This work was proposed by [Professor Filipe Moura](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/homepage/ist14188) for the [Mobility Urban Manamagement](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/GMU-2/2023-2024/2-semestre) signature.
